# ProEnd Scripts

This project contains two Bash scripts designed to handle and analyze multiple protein sequences. The scripts streamline the extraction and identification of specific C-terminal protein HbYX-motifs from a given FASTA file. The third script shows how to download the proteomes from UniProt.

If you have just one protein sequence or your file is already one protein sequence per line go to script 2
## Scripts

### 1. HbYX-First.bash

This script formats a multi-entry FASTA file into a single line per entry format, preparing it for further analysis. Use this script first if you have multiple sequences, a proteome, or alignments.

#### Usage

Ensure you have the necessary FASTA file in the same directory or specify the path to the file. Execute the script by running:

`#!bash
./HbYX-First.bash`

or 

`bash HbYX-First.bash `
This will output a file named `multifasta.ol.fa`, containing all the sequences from the original FASTA file, formatted for further processing.

### 2. HbYX-Second-Script.bash

This script searches for a specific HbYX-motif at the C-terminus of the protein sequences in the `multifasta.ol.fa` file created by the first script.

#### Usage

Run the script using:

`#!bash
./HbYX-Second-Script.bash`

or 

`bash HbYX-Second-Script.bash`
It will produce a file named `2aa.txt`, containing the motifs found along with the corresponding header from the FASTA file, if available.
